      "content": "Follow the instructions and get all the user stories below to pass to finish the project. Create your database by logging in to psql with `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=postgres`. You can query the database in your script with `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=salon -c \"SQL QUERY HERE\"`, add more flags if you need to. Be sure to get creative, and have fun!\n\n**Don't forget to connect to your database to add tables after you create it** :smile:\n\n**Hints:**\n- Your script needs to finish running after doing any of the tasks described below or the tests won't pass\n- The tests check the script output so don't use `clear` or other commands which might erase it\n- See `examples.txt` for example output of a passing script\n- The tests may add data to your database, feel free to delete it\n\n**Notes:**\nIf you leave your virtual machine, your database may not be saved. You can make a dump of it by entering `pg_dump -cC --inserts -U freecodecamp salon > salon.sql` in a bash terminal (not the psql one). It will save the commands to rebuild your database in `salon.sql`. The file will be located where the command was entered. If it's anything inside the `project` folder, the file will be saved in the VM. You can rebuild the database by entering `psql -U postgres < salon.sql` in a terminal where the `.sql` file is.\n\nIf you are saving your progress on freeCodeCamp.org, after getting all the tests to pass, follow the instructions above to save a dump of your database. Save the `salon.sql` file, as well as the final version of your `salon.sh` file, in a public repository and submit the URL to it on freeCodeCamp.org.",

The row should have the `customer_id` for that customer, and the `service_id` for the service entered",
